Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintanance of system applications
All round the world, software engeneers are in high demand.
The earning pontential technical roles proves one of the most popular benefits of software engeneering .
software engeneering leads to high job prospects that are helpfull and can lead to high incomes
It requres a variety of critical thinking that leads to problem solving in the industry


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) DEPLOYMENT; are the final stages of software development where the product is made available for users
2) IMPLEMENTATION; its the fast mileston to success where a road map is created for introducing new software or updates
3) ACCEPTABLE TESTING; a final process that meets the client and end-users requirements

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1; Planning
The team collects requirements from stakeholders, estimates resources and scheduled tasks
2; Design
Engeneers analyse requirements and choose solutions such as intergrating existing modules or selecting developments tools.
3; Implementation
The development team codes the product
4; Testing
The team uses manual and automated testing to check for bugs and ensures the software meets customer requirements
5; Deployment
The software is coded and tested on a seperate copy from the one users will acces
6; Maintanance
The team fixes bugs , resolves customer issues and manage software charges

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The main defference between the waterfall and the agile methodologies is that waterfall is a linear, sequential approach while agile is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility and adaptabiity
APPPROACH
Waterfall is a traditional , sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next level while agile is an iterative approach that breaks down features into smaller pieces and delivers themincrementally
FLEXIBILITY
Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project scope has been defined while agile is more flexible and can accomodate changes throuhout the development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1) Developing existins software systems: By testing ssystems regularly, software developers make sure the systems they develop fulfill their purpose accurately and efficiently
2) Debugging and troubleshooting: When issues arise, a software engeneer will come to the rescue by indentifying and resolving problems in the code.
3) Testing: Software engeneers are responsible for testing and debugging software applications.
4) Create and maitain software: They create software using the right programming languages, plartforms and archtechtures.
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1) Faster development; IDEs can help developers write code faster by automatically completing code , highlighting syntax and detecting errors
2) Leaa debuggging; IDEs can help developers spend less time debugging and fixing errors
3) Collaboration;VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same time without causing conflicts
4) Error recovery; VCS allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Security- the strategy of overcoming security is by developing a security mindset
Poor communication-its strategy is by being an active listener
Unrealistic timelines-its strategy is by understanding the motivation of deadlines
Rapid technological evolution-should acknowledge that alot of those technological changes happen

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING-is the process of testing the smallest functional units of code in a software application
Its important because it helps ensure code quality and functionalty.

INTERGRATION-Is a software testing method that verifies how the the differet parts of an aapplication work together
it helps improve quality by ensuring modules interact correctly

SYSTEM TESTING-Is a type of software testing that verifies that a fully intergrated system that meets its requirements and functions inteded
Its important because it helps ensure that a system meets its specifications and requirements and that it performs as expected.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING-Is a quality assurance process that verifies if a product, prototype, or software application meets specified requirements and is ready for release
It helps identifies flaws, improve product quality and gather feedback from users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the proces of designing inputs to guide AI models to generate desired outputs
Helps optimize how AI systems interact with users
Can help reduce bias that may be present in the training data of largr language models (LMS) 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
